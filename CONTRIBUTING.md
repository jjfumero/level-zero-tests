# Level-Zero Tests Contribution Guidelines

## Coding Guidelines

The code written for the Level-Zero Tests repo need to follow a series of coding
standards such that the look and feel of the tests is the same and the code
maintains a standard of C++ standards.

### Code Naming Conventions

* Class - UpperCamelCase - `class MyClass`
* Class data member - snake_case_with_suffix - `MyClass::my_class_data_member_`
* Struct - UpperCamelCase - `struct MyStruct`
* Struct data member - snake_case - `MyStruct::my_struct_data_member`
* Function - snake_case - `void my_function()`
* Variable - snake_case - `int my_variable`
* Constant - snake_case - `const int my_constant`
* Enum - snake_case - `enum class my_enum`
* Enum member - snake_case - `my_enum::my_enum_member`
* Namespace - snake_case - `namespace my_namespace`
* Macro - CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES - `#define MY_MACRO`
* Module - snake_case - `my_module`
* GTEST Test cases will follow the [Given/When/Then naming convention][given_when_then]

### C++ Coding standards

* C++11 maximum support
* Avoid C Arrays, replace with `std::array<>` / `std::vector<>`
* Avoid "magic numbers"
* Avoid C-style memory allocations in favor of C++
* Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL`
* Donâ€™t add `void` to empty argument lists
* Use `std::unique_ptr` in place of `std::auto_ptr`

### Code Formatting

* Follow [LLVM code formatting][llvm_code_formatting]

### Coding Standards Enforcement

* clang-format: Code Formatting before committing changes
* clang-tidy: Naming & Coding standards verified at build time if enabled
* Manual: Code Review checking (hopefully minimal due to above)


## Submitting Changes

[Merge requests][mrdoc] are used for proposing changes and doing code review.

Merge requests should be created from your personal branches that you've pushed
to the repository. Please do not create merge requests from forks of the
repository, as the CI will not be run.

If you have recently pushed to a branch in the project, you will see a handy
blue button on the [merge requests page][mrs] to create a new merge request from
that branch.

![Create a merge request from recently pushed branch][img:create_mr_from_branch]

The preferred naming convention for branches you push is `<idsid>/<identifier>`.

Example:

```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

$ git checkout -b ledettwy/contributing_file
Switched to a new branch 'ledettwy/contributing_file'

$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md

$ git commit -s -m "Add CONTRIBUTING.md"
[ledettwy/contributing_file 6092b15] Add CONTRIBUTING.md

remote: To create a merge request for ledettwy/contributing_file, visit:
remote:   https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/one-api/level_zero_tests/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=ledettwy%2Fcontributing_file

```

You can optionally specify that the remote source branch used for the merge
request get deleted after the request is accepted (I almost always do this).

Please mark the option to squash all your commits when the request is
accepted.

![Delete source branch and squash commits][img:delete_and_squash]

## Updating Changes

A change that you've submitted through a merge request can be updated by adding
additional commits to the branch the merge request was created from. These
commits do not need to be detailed, as the commit message from the first commit
will be used when they are squashed. CI automation will be executed every time
you push new commits to the branch, and the results of the CI jobs will be
visible in the merge request.

![Multiple commits in a merge request][img:many_changes]

Example:

```
$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md

$ git commit -s -m "update contributing.md"
[ledettwy/contributing_file 3114b43] update contributing.md

## Reviewing Changes

Comments and suggested changes can be submitted as code reviews from the Changes
tab in the merge request. Hover over a line number to insert a comment on a
line or set of lines.

![Add a suggested change][img:mr_suggestion]

Suggested changes can also [span multiple lines][mr_suggestion_multiline].

After you have finished adding all of the review comments and suggestions, you
can finish the review to submit them.

![Finishing a review][img:mr_finish_review]

The author of the merge request will be able to respond to your comments and
suggestions, and also optionally apply the suggestions directly as commits from
the web interface.

## Approvals

TODO: decide on approvers etc. for each class of tests. Maybe leverage a
CODEOWNERS file?
